# streamlit_data_vis
NYC_Crash_Visualization

Data was initially loaded from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes and cleaned using the code found in the NYC_Vehicle_Collissions_preprocessing file in order to reduce the file size

This is an example of streamlit application.

Note to user(s): CPU and ram usage maxes out if too many changes are made too quickly on app. Data file size was reduced to 1/4 of original file size during preprocessing by removing unneeded information. 

Anyone who would like to launch the project on their local machine can do so with the following steps: 
- clone the github repository to your local device
- make sure the requirements are installed on the local device
- open a terminal window and navigate to the folder which contains the main directory 
- run the streamlit application via the command 'streamlit run app.py'
- navigate a new browser tab to the address specified in the terminal
