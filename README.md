# streamlit_data_vis
NYC_Crash_Visualization

Data was initially loaded from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes and cleaned using the code found in the NYC_Vehicle_Collissions_preprocessing file in order to reduce the file size

This is an example of streamlit application.

Note to reviewer(s): CPU and ram usage maxes out if too many changes are made too quickly on app. Data file size was reduced to 1/4 of original file size during preprocessing.
